This project was created with inspiration from a test task. The task consists of creating an object Vagabond that can go left, right, up and down.

After little modifying one can see the process of wandering of vagabond on the canvas. Sometimes interesting pictures are shown on it. If one want to force the vagabond to go faster, he should to press Random button more times. =)
